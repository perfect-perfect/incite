    {{!-- the partial here is different then the post-info.handlebars. --}}
    {{!-- because the 'answers' array can't be deconstructed into an easily accesible variable name (because it's an array?), because array's don't have named properties like objects do --}}
    {{!-- we can use the keyword 'this' to refer to the parent object or array that's available in the context of the partial --}}
    {{!-- data that's passed to a template file is always part of 'this' but when dealing with objects, we can simply access the object properties directly (e.g. 'vote_count' instead of 'this.vote_count') --}}
